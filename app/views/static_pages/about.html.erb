<h2>Why Lugogram</h2>
<p>
All messages on Lugogram are private to and from your close friends. Not companies. Not ads. Not old school mates. 
The contents of messages are private forever (and will never be used to target adverticing).
</p>


<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Send private messages to people you know the email address of. They do not need to be Lugogram users.  </li>
	<li>Email notifications: These special someones will get an email with your message formated very nicely. Like this:</br><%= image_tag("welcome.png") %></li>
</ul>
