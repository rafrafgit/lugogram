<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Send private messages to anyone you know the email address of. This special someone will recieve an email with your message formated very nicely. Like this:</br><%= image_tag("welcome.png") %>
	</li>
	<li>In the web interface you can also click on a message to view all messages between you and the people that recieved that particular message. 
	</li>
</ul>
